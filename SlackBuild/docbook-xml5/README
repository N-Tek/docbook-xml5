docbook-xml5 is a group of shell scripts and 
required files used for creating a removable 
SlackBuild package for DocBook5 XML dtd and schemas
with XML stylesheets in a namespace

After the installation of DocBook5 XML dtd and schemas
with XML stylesheets in a namespace one of the new catalog 
files(docbook.new1 OR docbook.new2) has to be moved to the 
/etc/xml/docbook which was installed by the 'linuxdoc-tools' 
package located under 'slackware/ap'.

If 'docbookMathML1mods' was NOT installed
        docbook.new1 -> /etc/xml/docbook
else
        docbook.new2 -> /etc/xml/docbook

SlackBuild script file will check installation of 'docbookMathML1mods'
and include the related new catalog file into the 'docbook-xml5'
SlackBuild package as docbook.new

If /etc/xml/docbook.new is present it has to be manually moved by the 
user to /etc/xml/docbook for finalizing installation

After the uninstallation of the 'docbook-xml5' package
DON'T forget to reinstall 'linuxdoc-tools' package for 
resetting the /etc/xml/docbook and /usr/share/xml/ to 
its original state.
